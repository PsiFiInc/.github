# PsiFi Inc.

Welcome to **PsiFi Inc.**, where we are transforming global payments with our blockchain-native platform. We aim to make cross-border transactions fast, secure, and nearly free, focusing initially on the US-Mexico remittance corridor.

## Overview

PsiFi is a blockchain-based payments platform that enables users to send money instantly across borders with minimal fees. We leverage stablecoins to provide a reliable and efficient remittance solution, making global payments accessible for everyone, especially for underbanked communities. With our non-custodial approach, users retain full control over their funds, ensuring security and transparency.

## Features

- **Instant Payments**: Near-instant cross-border transactions.
- **Low Fees**: Minimal transaction costs, enabling affordable remittances.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for both crypto enthusiasts and newcomers.
- **Non-Custodial**: Users retain full control of their funds.
- **Stablecoin-Based**: Payments are made using stablecoins like USDC, with Tether support on the roadmap.
- **Freemium Model**: One free remittance per month, with additional transfers earned through referrals.

## Target Market

PsiFi initially targets the **$60 billion US-Mexico remittance market**, where digital transfers account for 99% of the transactions but are hindered by outdated payment rails. We aim to disrupt this space and expand into other Latin American corridors.

## How It Works

PsiFi’s platform uses blockchain technology to send payments directly from one wallet to another, utilizing stablecoins for price stability. By partnering with HoudiniSwap, we enable seamless swapping of currencies across different networks.

## Development

PsiFi’s tech stack includes:
